## Investments

#### What is an Investment?

An investment is a allocation of resource(s) (whether owned or borrowed, may or may not be leveraged) at a particular time in order to obtain a **larger amount of resource(s) back at some time in the future (subsequent to the time of allocation)**.  

Generally, capital or financial resources are assumed, but it may be human capital as well. If an activity is not done for this purpose, it is not an *Investment*.

#### Characteristics of an investment

Investments always have an element of unpredictability of outcome. This unpredictability stems from two factors:  

1. Actors involved
2. Time

Fundamentally, realization of investment require some form of transactions at least at the beginning and at the end. Transactions occur between two or more humans. Human behavior is unpredictable, therefore, investments are unpredictable.  

During the duration of "investment", prior to making the investment (consideration, analysis, assessment, decision and transaction), during the invested time and at the time of disposition of the investment, human behavior can be influenced by factors that are particular to that individual or by events external to that individual. 

Factors that is particular to an individual include things like:  
1. Intelligence
2. Level of education
3. Financial resources
4. Life stage
5. Financial requirements
6. Knowledge of finance

External events impact the person in some way, but that person has no discernable influence on the casue or outcome of the event. They include things like:   
1. Natural disasters
2. Man made disasters
3. Pandemic
4. Politics (US and International)

The future is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, this adds another dimension of unpredictablity to investments.  

#### What is the Goal in making an investment?

For rational actors making rational decisions, the goal of investment to obtain the greatest return of resources, with the greatest amount of certainty in the shortest period of time.  

Therefore, an investment manager needs to determine all the factors that are input to the investment, co-relate them to the outcome and make a decision on whether or not to make investment, and once invested, stay in or dispose of the investment.
