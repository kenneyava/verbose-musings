Life Instruction Manual  

My goal is most grandiose. I plan to make this repo into a compendium of instructions on how to live my life.

## Notice

This Document is about making some Bold Predictions

We need to make predictions, and make plans to take advantage of, or to avoid problems and issues, that we may encounter in the predicted environment.  plan and act accordingly

Our predictions will be macro in nature - but derived from micro economic events (Bottom-up approach).

We will take into account probabilities of our predictions.

We will be as much as possible, precise, logical and un-biased.

We will break down our cause of each circumstance that leads to our predictions.
